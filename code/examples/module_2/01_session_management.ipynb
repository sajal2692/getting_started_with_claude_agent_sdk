    "- **Resume** the conversation to continue building linearly\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Session ID**: Unique identifier for a conversation thread\n",
    "- **Resume**: Continue the same session linearly (keeps same session ID)\n",
    "- **Fork**: Create a new session that branches from the current state (generates new session ID)\n",
    "- **Context**: All previous messages and tool results are maintained in each session\n",

    "### The Workflow We'll Demonstrate\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create** initial content (formal announcement)\n",
    "2. **Fork** to try a different approach (casual version) - preserves original\n",
    "3. **Resume original** session to add more content (FAQ in formal tone)\n",

      "Hey team! 👋\n",
      "\n",
      "Quick heads up – starting next month, we're shifting to a 3-days-in-office schedule. This means we'll all be together in person three days a week, with two days remote.\n",
      "\n",
      "We think this'll help us collaborate better and hang out more as a team, while still keeping some of that WFH flexibility we all appreciate.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your manager will follow up soon with more details about which days work best for your team. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, feel free to drop them in the thread or reach out directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "**FAQ:**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: Which days do I need to be in the office?**\n",
      "A: This will vary by team! Your manager will work with you to figure out the best schedule. Some teams might have set days (like Tue/Wed/Thu), while others might have more flexibility depending on projects and meetings.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: What about parking?**\n",
      "A: Parking passes are available in the main lot. If you don't have one yet, reach out to [facilities/HR contact] to get set up. We're also looking into additional parking options if needed, so let us know if you run into any issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Q: What if I have special circumstances (childcare, medical appointments, etc.)?**\n",
      "A: We get it – life happens! If you need flexibility for ongoing circumstances, talk to your manager. We're happy to work with you on accommodations. For one-off situations, just give your manager a heads up like you normally would.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks everyone! 🙌\n",
